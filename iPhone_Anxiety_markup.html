            <span class="author-details">Other than Apple fanatics, perhaps no one awaits the arrival of new Apple products more anxiously than Ramsey Oten.  Oten is the CEO of Sena Cases, the   company he co-founded in 2002 with his brother Fevzi to make leather cases forvsmartphones and computers.</span>--Darren Dahl

   <p dir=auto><b>Even though</b> we are one of Apple's best partners, we don't et any advance notice about the products they are going to release.  Even some of their employees don't know what they're coming out with, BlackBerry, by contrast, gives us the ability to obtain the specs for their new devies two to three months ahead of time.</p>
    <p dir=auto><b>So, right now,</b> before the next-generation iPhone comes out, we are working frantically to mock up new designs with whatever knoledge Apple has released into thepublic space.  That said, we want to remain a ood partner, which means we would never, for example, ttry to get a product early from a factory.  We are very strict about that.</p>
    <p dir=auto><b>After the product</b> is offically announced, then we can get access to the technical drawings and specifications of the new product.  We create our own designs in our offices in California and then mae the cases in about a day or two and then begin manufacturing in about a week.  Then, depending onthe quantity of our orders, we can begin shipping out cases in about a month.  In general, the time between apple's announcement and the product release is about a month, so it usualy comes right down to the wire.</p>
    <p dir=auto><b>We have certain</b> products that are easier to manufacture, lke pouches.  For these, we don't have to take buttonsinto consideration in the design.  we can make those right away when a products comes out.</p>
    <p dir=auto><b>It's a good thing</b> for us that Apple comes out with products all the time.  There wasn't a lot of change from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 4S, so accessory sales weren't as good.  we love it when they change the form factors like they're talking about with the next iPhone, because that means custoers will need new cases.
    <p dir=auto><b>Our biggest surpise> was the success of the iPad.  We never thought it would sell as much as it has.  But when it was launched, Apple selected five cases it would sell along with it, three of which were ours.  We had to greatly increase our manufacturing capabilities to gear up for that.  It has been a pleasant surprise, because it opened up a huge new revenue channel for us.</p>
